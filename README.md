## Overview
The **Migrant Worker Support Platform** is a full-stack application designed to empower migrant workers by providing them with essential digital services.  
It helps them find jobs, negotiate wages, access loans based on work history and community reviews, seek legal support, and engage in a community forum.  
For workers without smartphones, the platform also integrates an **IVR system** that allows interaction via calls and SMS.  

An AI-powered **Neural-Symbolic RAG Chat Agent** further assists workers by answering their queries in an intuitive and personalized manner.
